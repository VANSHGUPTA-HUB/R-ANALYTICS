# R-ANALYTICS
This project applies predictive modeling techniques in R to estimate diamond prices based on attributes like carat weight, clarity, and color. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and machine learning models to determine key pricing factors.
Features
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Data cleaning, transformations, and visualization
✅ Price Prediction Models – Compare Linear Regression and Random Forest models
✅ Performance Evaluation – Measure accuracy using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
✅ Feature Selection – Identify key attributes influencing price

🛠️ Tech Stack
🔹 R – Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling
🔹 ggplot2, dplyr, caret, randomForest – Data visualization & modeling

📊 Key Analysis
📌 Data Preprocessing

Converted categorical columns to factors
Removed missing values for data consistency
📌 EDA & Visualizations

Histogram of Prices – Shows a right-skewed distribution
Scatter Plot (Carat Weight vs. Price) – Positive correlation observed
📌 Model Development & Comparison

Linear Regression: RMSE = 745.32
Random Forest: RMSE = 528.45 (better performance)
📂 Files Included
